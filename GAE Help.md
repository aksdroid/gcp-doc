Sure! Here's an example of how you can deploy an Angular app on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) App Engine using Nginx as the web server:

1. First, make sure you have the necessary prerequisites:
   - Install the Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
   - Set up a GCP project and enable the App Engine service: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard

2. Prepare your Angular app for deployment:
   - Build your Angular app by running `ng build --prod` in the project directory.
   - This will generate a `dist` directory containing the compiled app.

3. Create an `app.yaml` file in the project root directory with the following content:
   ```yaml
   runtime: python27
   api_version: 1
   threadsafe: true
   
   handlers:
   - url: /(.*\.(gif|png|jpg|ico|txt|js|css|html|woff|woff2|ttf|svg|eot)(\?.*)?)
     static_files: dist/\1
     upload: dist/(.*)(\?.*)?
   
   - url: /(.*)
     static_files: dist/index.html
     upload: dist/index.html
   ```

4. Create an `nginx.conf` file in the project root directory with the following content:
   ```
   worker_processes auto;
   events {
     worker_connections 1024;
   }
   
   http {
     include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
     default_type application/octet-stream;
     sendfile on;
     keepalive_timeout 65;
   
     server {
       listen 8080;
       root /var/www/html;
   
       location / {
         try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root directory with the following content:
   ```
   FROM nginx
   
   COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   COPY dist /var/www/html
   
   EXPOSE 8080
   ```

6. Build and push the Docker image to Container Registry:
   - Run `gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/[IMAGE_NAME]` in the project root directory.
   - Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your GCP project ID and `[IMAGE_NAME]` with a desired name for your Docker image.

7. Deploy the app on App Engine:
   - Run `gcloud app deploy` in the project root directory.
   - Follow the prompts to choose the region and confirm deployment.

After the deployment is complete, your Angular app will be accessible at `https://[PROJECT_ID].appspot.com`. Make sure to replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your actual GCP project ID.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you may need to adjust the configuration files according to your specific app requirements.
